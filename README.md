# Mac Man

## Overview
Mac Man is based on the 80s' classic arcade game.  It was my first big individual project that was a part of my Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. The objective was to create a grid-based game to be rendered in a browser using 'vanilla' JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project was to be completed within a week, and it gave me an opportunity to practice and apply front-end knowledge gained thus far by interacting with DOM objects. 

Given a selection of games to recreate, I opted for Pac-Man with a personalised theme. 
To understand the following documentation, please note that the corresponding characters and elements of the orginal game are as follows:
* Pac-Man = eater
* ghosts = scale1, scale2, scale3, scale4
* coins = food
* power pellet = powerfoood

Currently, the game is not complete and is still under works. It has its MVP and you can play it [here](file:///Users/hongvan/development/project-1/index.html) and the GitHub repo can be accessed [here](https://github.com/hvan307/project-1).

## The Brief
* Render a game in the browser
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## The Technologies used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Git and GitHub
* Google Fonts
* Pixel Art

# Approach 
## The Map

## Scale Movement

## Eater Movement

## Collisions

## Variables

## Bugs

## Challenges

## Lesson learned

## Potential additional features
* Localstorage for the leader scoreboard 
* A 'scare mode' for the scales when the powerfood is eaten, so that the Eater can catch a scale and send it back to its starting position
* Mobile-friendly version
* Creating 'identities' and different behavioural patterns for each of the scales
* Further levels and alternative maps
